#GitHub Lecture
I am my teammate's wingman today. Today was a great day since I learned how to update the media on a website and how to select high-quality photos for our project.
Additionally, I learn how to use the Smart Star and when to use it. In the Smart Star, I must describe the project I am starting in depth in order to say what I am going to do.
